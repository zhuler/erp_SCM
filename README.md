# erp_SCM

This is the source code for Supply Chain Management for Enterprise Resource Planning.

The project will be coded in PHP with support for XAMPP and probably javascripts for delivering graphical representations.

The index.php file could link to individual folders of the modules recently added. Then we can integrate them later on.
